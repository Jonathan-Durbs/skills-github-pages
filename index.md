I am a mathematics and political science undergraduate student at Northern Illinois University.
I am curently applying to the NSF GRFP and funded graduate program in Political Science. 
Previous work includes a campus wide survey of environmental attitudes and behaviors (BARKS Survey) and a replication and extension of E. Henderson's Disturbing the Peace (2009).
Current work is in creating and applying extradyadic variables to traditionally dyadic regression analysis.
Future work in graudate school will focus on adapting Social Network Analysis, qualitative analysis, and other methodologies to Foreign Policy Analysis.
