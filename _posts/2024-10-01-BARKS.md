# What is BARKS
The BARKS Survey or the Behaviors, Attitudes, Resources, and Knowledge of Sustainability Survey, was a survey of Students, Faculty, and Staff of Northern Illinois University.  

# Role in BARKS
I was the lead data analyst of BARKS and was in charge of cleaning the data, ananomysing as needed, and creating graphs for the report. 
I was given the opportunity to add a battery of questions to the survey and so I added commute behvior questions, this was used by me in the creation of a GHG emissions estimate and regression, it was seperately utilized by the Office of Sustainability.
The graphs I created utilizing R are in the BARKS Report hosted by the Office of Sustainability, a presentation to VP's of the univeristy, and a poster presentation at CURE. 
Additionally, I wrote the section on commute behavior that is in the BARKS Report as well as helping with the editing and organization of the document as a whole.
